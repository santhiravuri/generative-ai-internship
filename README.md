In simple terms, Generative AI is where machines create—text, images, audio, code, and more. What makes it exciting is how it’s already part of our daily life:
Tools like ChatGPT for writing and brainstorming
AI art from text prompts (like DALL·E)
Music generation and content creation
Even drug discovery and smart assistants!
It’s amazing to see how AI is not just about predictions, but creativity.
